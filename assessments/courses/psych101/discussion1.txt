PROMPT:
Reflect on the ethical guidelines that govern psychological research today. Consider the following questions:

1. Why are institutional review boards (IRBs) important for protecting research participants?
2. Choose one famous psychology study from the past (such as Milgram's obedience study or Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment) and discuss what ethical concerns it raises.
3. How do you think researchers should balance the pursuit of scientific knowledge with the protection of participants?

Support your argument with specific examples from the readings or lectures. Be prepared to engage thoughtfully with your classmates' perspectives.
